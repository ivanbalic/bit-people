## BIT People Project

User is able to see a LIST/GRID of users when App is started and have
possibility to switch users view between LIST and GRID using view
change button in the header.

Each list and grid item displays:

- Avatar in circle
- Full name
- Email icon and hidden email address
- Birth date in DD.MM.YYYY format

When App is closed it saves previous state, users that are displayed
last, view mode (GRID/LIST), and when it opens again the same state is
shown as before.

User have possibility to refresh users by clicking refresh button in
header. App also keeps track of the time when laste user refresh is
done and displays that info in the footer, as well as gender
statistics wichi are displayed under the search bar.
